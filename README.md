## Getting-Started

This will go through how to setup the repo in order for you to begin using it.

1.  Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/Kkkermit/jest-ts-example.git`.
2.  Once you've cloned the repo, navigate to your terminal and then `cd` in the main folder by using `cd ts-ui-example` and install the `node_modules` with `npm i`.

    - _If installing the `node_modules` give an error, try running `npm i --force`_

3.  Once the modules have installed, you can then run the command `npm run dev`. Once ran, it will create a local host on port `5173` or if that's unavailable, `5174`. The link to the local host will be/ look like this **http://localhost:5173/**
4.  That should be it on running the repo and getting it started on a local host.
